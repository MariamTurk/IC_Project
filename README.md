# 16-Bit CMOS Comparator Design

This repository presents the design, layout, simulation, and performance analysis of a 16-bit comparator built using CMOS technology. The project includes the development of 1-bit, 4-bit, and 16-bit comparators using PMOS and NMOS transistors along with basic logic gates like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT. The design was implemented and verified using the Electric VLSI tool and LTspice for simulation.

## üßæ Abstract

This project implements a 16-bit digital comparator using CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology. The design process starts from a 1-bit comparator, builds up to a 4-bit version, and scales to a 16-bit comparator. Logic gates and transistor-level schematics are developed using Electric Binary 9.07, and their functionality is validated through LTspice simulations. This comparator outputs whether input A is greater than, less than, or equal to input B.
